## Introduction
From October through to April, myself and five other students were tasked with creating a possible smart home system for the [Solar Decathlon Middle East 2020](https://www.solardecathlonme.com/) project.

The SDME is a project in which teams compete to ["design, build and operate a grid-connected, solar powered house."](https://www.hw.ac.uk/news/articles/2019/SolarDecathlon2020.htm)
