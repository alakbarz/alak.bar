## Who Are Team <span style="color: #009877">ESTEEM</span>?

Team ESTEEM are a group of students from Heriot-Watt Universty taking on the Solar Decathlon Middle East 2020 ([SDME](https://www.solardecathlonme.com/)) project. There are roughly 120 students in this group, ranging from engineering, business, computer science, and so much more! 

The group formed back in August 2018, though I only joined them in the summer of 2020. As I grew increasingly invested in the team, I took on greater responsibilities; I am now Head of the Audiovisual and Website teams whilst helping out the Software & Sensors team when I can.

## What Do <span style="color: #009877">ESTEEM</span> Do?

We're designing and building a sustainable, eco-friendly, solar powered home from the ground up. We're finding our own sponsors to help fund the project and, with help from the university, we plan to showcase our prototype at the World Expo in Dubai around October 2021!

## Website Redesign

Before I joined the team, WordPress was used because it allowed for people without web development experience to update the contents of pages. The only problem was that people found it difficult to use. This left the website looking quite messy with inconsistencies from page to page, not to mention the unwillingness of members to make edits when needed.

I had been wanting to remake the website, but alone I did not feel confident that I would be able to find the time. This led to the recruitment of [Mohit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohit-katta/) and [Pranav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranav-chachara/), two Computer Science students at the Dubai campus of Heriot-Watt.

We decided to use ReactJS due to its popularity in the web dev scene and to use it as an opportunity to advance our own skills. In hindsight, React is overkill for a project like this; a simple static website would have been enough! Regardless, the experience was worth it.
