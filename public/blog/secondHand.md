# Stop Buying New Stuff (and Buy Second Hand Instead)
*Why you should consider spending the extra time and effort in buying second hand goods*

> Keep buying new stuff. There is nothing inherently wrong with doing so. My goal is only to try and make a case for opting to buy second hand items when you can.

Why should I consider buying used goods? If I can afford buying an item brand new then why waste time looking for the same product elsewhere?

Let's look at a few reasons why:
