# alak.bar Website Source Code
The [alak.bar](https://alak.bar) website source code resides here for those who want to see an example of [Macaron](https://go-macaron.com/) in action.

## What Is "Macaron"?
"...macaron is a high productive and modular web framework in [Go](https://golang.org/)".

It's simplicity and ease of use are what make it preferable to me over [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), for example.
